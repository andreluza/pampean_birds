The models' design looks like:

# Global model

```{r comment='', echo = F}
cat(readLines('model_acoustics.txt'), sep = '\n')
``` 
# Grassland model


```{r comment='', echo = F}
cat(readLines('model_acoustics_grass.txt'), sep = '\n')
``` 


# Null model

```{r comment='', echo = F}
cat(readLines('model_acoustics_null.txt'), sep = '\n')
```
